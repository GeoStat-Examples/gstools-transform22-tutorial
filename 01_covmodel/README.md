# The Covariance Model

One of the fundamental features of GSTools is the powerful `CovModel` class, which allows you to easily define arbitrary covariance models by
yourself. The resulting models provide a bunch of nice features to explore the
covariance models.

A covariance model is used to characterize the
[semi-variogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variogram#Semivariogram),
denoted by $\gamma$, of a spatial random field.
In GSTools, we use the following formulation for an isotropic and stationary field:

$\gamma\left(r\right)=\sigma^2\cdot\left(1-\mathrm{cor}\left(s\cdot\frac{r}{\ell}\right)\right)+n$

Where:

  - $ r $ is the lag distance
  - $ \ell $ is the main correlation length
  - $ s $ is a scaling factor for unit conversion or normalization
  - $ \sigma^2 $ is the variance
  - $ n $ is the nugget (subscale variance)
  - $ \mathrm{cor}(h) $ is the normalized correlation function depending on
    the non-dimensional distance $ h=s\cdot\frac{r}{\ell} $

Depending on the normalized correlation function, all covariance models in
GSTools are providing the following functions:

  - $ \rho(r)=\mathrm{cor}\left(s\cdot\frac{r}{\ell}\right) $
    is the so called
    [correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocovariance#Normalization)
    function
  - $ C(r)=\sigma^2\cdot\rho(r) $ is the so called
    [covariance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_function)
    function, which gives the name for our GSTools class

.. note::

   We are not limited to isotropic models. GSTools supports anisotropy ratios
   for length scales in orthogonal transversal directions like:

   - $ x_0 $ (main direction)
   - $ x_1 $ (1. transversal direction)
   - $ x_2 $ (2. transversal direction)
   - ...

   These main directions can also be rotated.
   Just have a look at the corresponding examples.
