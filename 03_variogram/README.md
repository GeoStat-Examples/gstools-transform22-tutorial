# Variogram Estimation

Estimating the spatial correlations is an important part of geostatistics.
These spatial correlations can be expressed by the variogram, which can be
estimated with the subpackage `gstools.variogram`. The variograms can be
estimated on structured and unstructured grids.

See Wikipedia: [(semi-)variogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variogram#Semivariogram).
